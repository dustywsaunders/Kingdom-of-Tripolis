We built this game as a classic top-down rpg style puzzler. 
The aim of the game is to reach the Loot Chest first, while avoiding the skeletons.

The front-end was developed using only `React` and `Redux`. 
The back-end was implimented using `Websocket`

## Game Rules

Player 1 - Use arrow keys to navigate around the map
Player 2 - Use W A S D to bavigate around the map
Avoid the Skeletons! They will onky move onnce a player moves.
Plan your moves carefully OR run like a crazed bat out of hell.
Be the first to claim the LOOT!

## Install

The `Server` is deployed to Heroku. 
If all dynos are running, you only need to run the `Client`

```sh
cd client/
npm install
npm run start
```

If dynos have been stopped, you can run the `Server` locally:
** NOTE: Run `Client` as mentioned above **

```sh
cd server/
npm install
npm run start
```
